A little web app to resize icons and splashscreen for iOS app.

You can test it here : http://www.jaskar.host-ed.me/iOS_app_Icon_Splash_resizer/
Or download / fork it / use it as you want.

Two buttons.

1) Select an icon (best 2048*2048 or 1024*1024). Then the app resize it and auto download files.
2) Select a splashscreen (best 4000*2250). Then, the app resize and crop it if needed and auto download files.

That's it.
